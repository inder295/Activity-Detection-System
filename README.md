This project is an Activity Detection System designed to manage user interactions and parcel activities with a comprehensive set of features, including user authentication, task scheduling, and a dynamic frontend interface. Below is an overview of the system and its core components:

--Backend Development
1.Node.js & MongoDB: Backend development is powered by Node.js for server-side logic and MongoDB for data storage.
2.JWT Authentication: Implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) to ensure secure user registration and login functionalities.
3.MVC Structure: The backend is well-structured using controllers, routes, and middleware to handle various requests and responses.
4.API Testing: All API endpoints are thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure reliable and secure backend operations.

--Background Services
1.Task Scheduling with Node-Cron: Implemented background services using the node-cron package to schedule recurring tasks, such as notifications.
2.Email Notifications: Integrated a robust email service to send automated welcome emails and other notifications, using reusable email templates.


--Admin Dashboard
1.React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS: The admin dashboard is built with modern technologies, offering a responsive and interactive UI for managing the system.
2.Comprehensive Layout: The dashboard includes a navbar, footer, sidebar, and various pages to allow easy navigation and management.
3.Parcel & User Management: Admins can create, update, and manage parcels and user accounts through an intuitive interface.
4.Authentication Pages: Dedicated login and registration pages for the admin panel.


--Frontend Development
1.React Frontend: Developed the user-facing frontend using React for efficient rendering and interactivity.
2.Page Designs: Created functional pages like My Parcels, Home, Login, and Parcel Detail Views to provide users with a smooth experience.
3.Backend Integration: The frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend, fetching and displaying data in real-time.
4.Redux Toolkit: Implemented state management and data persistence using Redux Toolkit to ensure consistency across the application.
